Hi, my name is Lobsang Tenzin and I am currently enrolled in the blockchain development program at George Brown College. Over the course of this program, I have gained knowledge of blockchain and its use in the industry which allows me to see the problems in using blockchain. I have also learned different programming languages such as react, node, and solidity that let me create Dapp projects some of which you can see at my GitHub account here. Thank you for your time and if there is a position open for blockchain, I hope you think of me.
